Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network.

Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

B ACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION\\nOn July 18, 2023, Meta announced the release of Llama\\n2, the next generation of their open-source large language\\nmodel (LLM) [1]. Llama 2 is available for both research and\\ncommercial use, with Microsoft as its preferred partner. This\\nopen-source model serves as a foundational AI technology\\nthat empowers businesses and developers to create advanced\\napplications such as chatbots and personal assistants, which\\nrequire the generation of human-like text. It offers a solution\\nfor organizations that may lack the resources to develop such\\ncomplex models from scratch.\\nAccording to the official Hugging Face organization for\\nLlama 2 models from Meta 1, Llama 2 comprises pretrained\\nand fine-tuned generative text models ranging from 7 billion\\nto 70 billion parameters among these models, Llama-2-Chat\\nhas been specifically optimized for dialogue-based use cases\\n[1]. Notably, Llama-2-Chat models excel in open-source chat\\nmodel benchmarks and receive favorable evaluations in terms\\n∗Corresponding Author: Zhaoxia W ANG (e-mail: zxwang@smu.edu.sg)\\n1https://huggingface.co/meta-llama\\nof helpfulness and safety, rivaling some well-known closed-\\nsource models like ChatGPT [2], [3] and PaLM [4].\\nUpon Meta’s announcement, we promptly submitted a re-\\nquest for a commercial license, which was granted shortly.\\nThis license enables us to conduct comprehensive comparisons\\nbetween Llama 2 models and other large language models\\n(LLMs). This paper delves into the capabilities of Llama 2,\\nwith a particular emphasis on its role in in-context learning —\\nan emerging AI design pattern that harnesses pretrained LLMs\\nto process confidential and sensitive data. We have made the\\nfollowing contributions:\\n• Developed unique metrics and methodologies to assess\\nthe in-context learning of Llama 2 against various LLMs.\\n• Performed an in-depth comparison of Llama-2 models\\nwith other top-tier LLMs, emphasizing their in-context\\nlearning strengths.\\n• Beyond corroborating Meta’s claims about Llama-2’s\\ncapabilities, we’ve highlighted its commercial potential\\nand offered insights for seamless enterprise adoption.\\nII. R ELATED WORK\\nIn recent years, the rapid advancement of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of natural\\nlanguage processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI).\\nWith the introduction of Llama 2 [1], there has been a surge\\nof interest in evaluating and harnessing its capabilities. In\\nthis section, we review related work that contextualizes our\\ncomprehensive evaluation of Llama 2 and its implications for\\nAI applications, with a particular focus on in-context learning.\\nA. Advances in Large Language Models\\nThe development of LLMs has been a focal point of research\\nand innovation in the field of NLP [5]–[7]. LLMs have a great\\ndeal of potential as capable AI assistants that can carry out\\ncomplex reasoning tasks in a variety of disciplines. Due to\\nthe ease with which they may promote human engagement\\nthrough user-friendly chat interfaces, they have been quickly\\nand widely accepted by the general public. Notable models\\nlike GPT-3 and others have demonstrated the potential of\\npre-trained LLMs in various applications, ranging from text\\ngeneration to translation and dialogue systems [2], [7].'),\n",

In-Context Learning and Pre-trained LLMs\\nIn-context learning, as an AI design pattern, has gained\\nprominence for its ability to process confidential and sensitive\\ndata using pre-trained LLMs [8]. Prior studies have explored\\nthe use of LLMs for handling contextually relevant informa-\\ntion and generating context-aware responses [9]. We aim to\\ncontribute to this area of research by providing a comprehen-\\nsive evaluation of Llama 2’s performance and suitability for in-\\ncontext learning, shedding light on its strengths and potential\\nuse cases.\\nC. Comparative Analyses of LLMs\\nComparative analyses of LLMs have been instrumental\\nin assessing their capabilities and identifying their relative\\nadvantages. Existing research has compared different LLMs\\non various benchmarks, considering factors such as answer\\nquality [10] [11], inference speed [11] [12], and safety [13].\\nOur study aligns with this research theme, as we conduct\\na rigorous comparative analysis between Llama 2 and other\\nopen-source LLMs and OpenAI models, aiming to provide\\ninsights into its competitive edge and unique contributions.\\nIII. M ETHODOLOGY\\nIn this section, we present our approach and methodology\\nfor the comprehensive evaluation of Llama 2, with a specific\\nfocus on its application in in-context learning, as well as its\\ncomparison with existing large language models (LLMs). Our\\nmethodology encompasses data collection and preprocessing,\\nmodel selection, in-context learning workflow and evaluation\\nmetrics.\\nBy adopting this systematic approach, we harness in-context\\nlearning’s potential, ensuring efficient and secure interactions\\nwith Large Language Models.\\nA. Data Collection and Preprocessing\\nTo rigorously evaluate Llama 2’s capabilities, we employed\\na subset of the MS MARCO dataset, a comprehensive reading\\ncomprehension and question answering dataset curated by\\nMicrosoft 2. We carefully handpicked 100 queries with well-\\nformed answers across five categories (LOCATION, NU-\\nMERIC, PERSON, DESCRIPTION, ENTITY), resulting in\\na test dataset comprising 500 queries. Table I provides an\\noverview of this evaluation dataset.\\nB. Model Selection\\nWe purposefully chose our models to ensure a thorough\\ncomparative study. Llama 2 was our primary focus given its\\nrecent emergence and the notable features discussed in the\\nrelated work section. Alongside it, we evaluated established\\nLLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and several leading open-source\\n2https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Question-Answering\\\\#qa\\nmodels. However, due to our GPU cluster’s memory con-\\nstraints (48GB), we restricted our evaluation to open-source\\nLLMs with up to 13B parameters. This selection framework\\nwas designed to benchmark Llama 2 against recognized stan-\\ndards, helping us discern its distinctive value in the domain.\\nC. Experiment Setup\\nTo assess the in-context learning proficiency of chosen\\nLLMs, we crafted a Python application leveraging LangChain\\n3, a renowned open-source platform tailored for seamless\\nintegration with LLMs. For each query in our evaluation set,\\nthe program creates a prompt that combines the query with its\\nassociated 10 passages for context. This prompt is forwarded\\nto the LLM to produce a response. The generated answer\\nis then compared with the established ground truth to assess\\nits accuracy. Table II provides a visual representation of this\\nprocess using sample data from a specific query.\\nUpon processing all 500 queries, the application computes\\nvarious evaluation metrics, details of which are elucidated in\\nthe ensuing section.\\nD. Evaluation Metrics\\nWhen appraising the performance of Llama 2 and its coun-\\nterparts, we adopted a suite of metrics specifically designed\\nfor in-context learning evaluations:\\n• Inference Speed: This metric gauges the rapidity of the\\nmodels in processing queries and generating outputs, a\\npivotal attribute for applications necessitating real-time\\nresponses. It’s quantified in terms of tokens generated\\nper second.\\n• Answer Quality: A measure of the precision and per-\\ntinence of the answers produced by the models in the\\nrealm of in-context learning. Aligning with the official\\nbenchmarks for Question Answering and Natural Lan-\\nguage Generation tasks 4, we opted for Rouge-L [14],\\n[15] and Bleu-1 [16] to assess answer quality.\\nIV. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\\nIn this section, we showcase the results of our in-depth\\ncomparison between Llama 2 and other prominent LLMs, es-\\npecially those from OpenAI. Our analysis covers aspects such\\nas answer quality and inference speed, and we explore their\\nrelevance in the context of in-context learning applications.\\nA. Inference Speed\\nWe evaluated inference speeds by running our test program\\non Nvidia A40 and L40 GPUs for Llama-2 and various open-\\nsource models. To optimize costs, we restricted testing of\\nOpenAI models to the A40. Figure 1 presents the results,\\nhighlighting that the newer L40 GPU enhances inference speed\\nby 24% to 49%, contingent on the LLM in use.\\n3https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain\\n4https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/'),\n",

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

The conﬁguration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α= 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9'),\n",

    "\n",
    "##### a. **`embedding_function=google_embeddings`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is an embedding function?**\n",
    "  An embedding function is a tool that converts text, images, or other data into vectors (numerical arrays). These vectors are created in such a way that similar data points (e.g., texts with similar meanings) have vectors that are close together.\n",
    "* **What does `google_embeddings` do?**\n",
    "  It’s likely a pre-trained embedding function from Google, used here to turn documents or queries into vectors. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  \"apple\" -> [0.1, 0.2, 0.9, ...] (vector representation)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### b. **`index=faiss_index`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is `faiss_index`?**\n",
    "  This is the data structure from FAISS where the vectors are stored. It’s like a database but optimized for searching similar vectors efficiently.\n",
    "* **Why use it?**\n",
    "  The FAISS index enables fast similarity searches, which is especially useful for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### c. **`docstore=InMemoryDocstore()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is `docstore`?**\n",
    "  A document store is where the actual data (e.g., full documents or text) is stored.\n",
    "* **Why use `InMemoryDocstore`?**\n",
    "  `InMemoryDocstore` keeps the data in memory (RAM) for quick access. It’s simple and fast but not suitable for very large datasets because it depends on your machine’s memory capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### d. **`index_to_docstore_id={}`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is `index_to_docstore_id`?**\n",
    "  This is a mapping between the FAISS index and the document IDs in the document store.\n",
    "* **Why use it?**\n",
    "  When FAISS finds a vector in the index, it needs to know which document in the `docstore` the vector represents. This mapping ensures you can retrieve the corresponding document.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Purpose of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet creates a **FAISS-powered vector search system** with the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embed:** Use `google_embeddings` to turn your documents into vectors.\n",
    "2. **Store:** Save these vectors in `faiss_index` for quick similarity searching.\n",
    "3. **Document Access:** Keep the original documents in `InMemoryDocstore` so that you can retrieve them after finding similar vectors.\n",
    "4. **Mapping:** Use `index_to_docstore_id` to link vectors in the FAISS index with documents in the `docstore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **How It Works in Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of what this setup allows you to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a dataset of articles.\n",
    "2. You convert each article into a vector using `google_embeddings`.\n",
    "3. Store these vectors in `faiss_index` and the full articles in `InMemoryDocstore`.\n",
    "4. When a user asks a question (query), it’s converted into a vector using `google_embeddings`.\n",
    "5. FAISS finds the most similar vectors (articles) in `faiss_index`.\n",
    "6. You use the mapping (`index_to_docstore_id`) to retrieve the actual articles from `InMemoryDocstore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Simplified Analogy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of FAISS as a library system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FAISS Index:** The catalog cards, organized for quick searches.\n",
    "* **Document Store:** The shelves with actual books.\n",
    "* **Embedding Function:** The tool that describes each book in numerical form for cataloging.\n",
    "* **Mapping:** The link between catalog cards and books.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows you to quickly find and retrieve books (documents) based on their description (vector similarity).\n"

      "is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n",
      "3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
      "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
      "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
      "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
      "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
      "typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
      "[31, 2, 8].\n",
      "• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
      "and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
      "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
      "encoder.\n",
      "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
      "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
      "information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
      "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
      "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
      "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
      "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
      "FFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\n",
      "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
      "from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
      "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
      "dff = 2048.\n",
      "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
      "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
      "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\n",
